                <p>Women's empowerment is the process in which women elaborate and recreate what it is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.[1][2] Empowerment can be defined in many ways, however, when talking
                    about women's empowerment, empowerment means accepting and allowing people (women) who are on the outside of the decision-making process into it. “This puts a strong emphasis on participation in political structures and formal decision-making
                    and, in the economic sphere, on the ability to obtain an income that enables participation in economic decision-making.”[3] Empowerment is the process that creates power in individuals over their own lives, society, and in their communities.
                    People are empowered when they are able to access the opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense
                    of empowerment. Empowerment includes the action of raising the status of women through education, raising awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment is all about equipping and allowing women to make life-determining decisions
                    through the different problems in society.
                    <p> [4] Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted
                        <!-- from such an ability. [1] There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than
                    have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment
                    and disempowerment is relative to other at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.
